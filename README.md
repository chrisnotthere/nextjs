# NextJS Image Gallery - Learning Project


> **Note:** This project is taken from the NextJS tutorial series by 'Coding in Flow' on YouTube. You can access the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfer6xMp2A).

This project is a reference and showcase of the latest features of NextJS 13, with a focus on different data fetching and caching strategies. Its primary purpose is to serve as a practical guide and learning resource for the new NextJS 13 app directory and its capabilities.

## Features

This project illustrates several NextJS features, including:

- Static and Dynamic Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- Route handlers (API endpoints)
- Meta-data API

Each page of the application implements a different approach to fetching and caching data to demonstrate the versatility and power of NextJS.

## Live Demo
